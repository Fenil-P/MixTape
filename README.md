# MixTape
React web application made using components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. It prortizes responsive design to allow quick access from a varitey of designs.

This program is a playlist builder built and designed to work with Spotify. With that in mind, you should have a Spotify account before you try to use this app. (Alternatively, you can just "borrow" someone else's account for a bit. But, that's on you.)
